Analysis of Multi-omics genomics data
===============================

Project for BIOS 611: Intro. to Data Science

The datasets of interest for analysis are from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession GSE155673. The study is on ??? 	Systems biological assessment of immunity to severe and mild COVID-19 infections???. The study uses a new sequencing technology (CITE-seq) that enables simultaneous sequencing of both RNA and surface protein abundance of single cells. With both measurements, it could strengthen our understanding of cells, such as differentially expressed genes across different cell types and states.

The datasets provided by Stoeckius et al. are sequenced on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Exploratory analysis will be conducted on this new type of sequencing data. One of the main interests is analyzing the integrated data, that is, integrating the RNA expression with protein abundance data. Detail analyses include cell classification and differentially expressed gene identification. Further, analysis can also be performed on each measurement, and results can be compared. Last, most analyses will be using currently available methods and packages.

I will likely downsize the datasets so all procedures can be executed in a reasonable timeframe.
